      <p>Hello, beloved, I keep thinking about you, always.</p>
      <p>As your boyfriend, I know I could not show you the beautiful gestures you deserved. I could not give you letters or cards or those small things that mean so much to you. And I know that mattered.</p>
      <p>It was never because I did not care. Sometimes I struggled to express what lived quietly inside me.</p>
      <p>This isn’t me trying to convince you to take me back. These words are for making things right that I’ve been doing wrong for so damn long.</p>
      <p>You are truly an amazing person, and I want you to know just how much I admire you. Your strength and grace have always captivated me. You were the light of my life. your laughter has always put me in a trance that I can still feel, even now.</p>
      <p>I truly wish I could go back and offer you the love you deserved, the thoughtful notes, the surprise dates, the little reminders of my affection that you cherished so deeply.</p>
      <p>You deserve someone who not only sees you but truly appreciates everything that you are. I wanted you to feel like I was that person for you.</p>
      <p>As I reflect on what we once had, I can’t help but dream of a future where you continue to thrive and shine, whether that's alongside me or someone new or on your own. I want the best for you, always. You deserve to be celebrated for the incredible person you are, and I hope you always recognize that, even in moments of doubt.</p>
      <p>I also want you to know that, i'd have happily given my all to save you, even from yourself. I'd have done everything for us to be together, I still will if I see that i am not ruining the peace you have left in your life...</p>
      <p>Thank you for being a part of my life, for teaching me and showing me what love can look like. I will carry the lessons you taught me in my heart forever, and I hope you find nothing but joy and fulfillment in the days ahead.</p>
      <p>With all my best wishes,<br>hsn</p>
